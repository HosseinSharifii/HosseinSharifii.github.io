                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Cardiomyocytes can adapt their size, shape, and orientation in response to altered biomechanical or biochemical stimuli. 
                  The process by which the heart undergoes structural changes—affecting both geometry and material properties-in response 
                  to altered ventricular loading, altered hormonal levels, or mutant
                  sarcomeric proteins is broadly known as cardiac growth 
                  and remodeling (G&R). Although it is likely that cardiac G&R initially occurs as an adaptive response of the heart to the 
                  underlying stimuli, prolonged pathological changes can lead to increased risk of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and sudden death. 
                  During the past few decades, computational models have been extensively used to investigate the mechanisms of cardiac G&R, 
                  as a complement to experimental measurements. These models have provided an opportunity to quantitatively study the relationships 
                  between the underlying stimuli (primarily mechanical) and the adverse outcomes of cardiac G&R, i.e., alterations in ventricular 
                  size and function. State-of-the-art computational models have shown promise in predicting the progression of cardiac G&R. 
                  However, there are still limitations that need to be addressed in future works to advance the field. In this review, 
                  we first outline the current state of computational models of cardiac growth and myofiber remodeling. Then, we discuss the 
                  potential limitations of current models of cardiac G&R that need to be addressed before they can be utilized in clinical care. 
                  Finally, we briefly discuss the next feasible steps and future directions that could advance the field of cardiac G&R.

                Triage method for load rating bridge size two-cell reinforced concrete boxculverts for the AASHTO LRFD design load.

                 <strong>Abstract:</strong> Reinforced concrete bridge size box culverts (RCBCs), with structure length greater 
                 than or equal to 6.1 m (20 ft), are an integral part of the transportation infrastructure. Load rating RCBCs 
                 is essential, and the critical component is generally the top slab. The objective of this study is to propose 
                 a triage methodology to quickly and conservatively determine the rating factor (RF) for the top slab of a two-cell 
                 RCBC. The derivation of the demand equations is illustrated in this manuscript for the top slab and the AASHTO HL-93 
                 live load. The finite element program CANDE is used to evaluate the influence of the cell clear height (H), cell 
                 clear span (S), fill height (HF), and the backfill modulus (E) on the demand loads. Multiple regression analyses 
                 showed that H had no significant effect on the dead load demands, while H and E had no significant effect to the 
                 live load demands. Conservative linear demand equations (LDEs) are presented to calculate the dead and live load 
                 demands leading to a quick determination of the RF. LDEs for single and multi-cell culverts can be derived following 
                 the LDE procedure outlined herein.
